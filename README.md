# vehicle cutin-detection
 This project integrates object detection and tracking with collision warning systems to enhance vehicle safety. Utilizing YOLOv8 for object detection and DeepSort for tracking, the system identifies and follows vehicles in real-time. Speeds are estimated by analyzing positional changes across frames, while distances between vehicles are calculated using bounding box coordinates. A collision detection function evaluates risks based on predefined distance and speed thresholds, issuing alerts if necessary. This comprehensive approach provides real-time warnings to prevent collisions, improving road safety through timely and accurate detection, tracking, and risk assessment.
